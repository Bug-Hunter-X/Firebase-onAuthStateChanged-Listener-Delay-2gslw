The Firebase SDK's `onAuthStateChanged` listener might not trigger immediately after a successful login or registration. This can lead to unexpected behavior if your application relies on the user's authentication state to proceed to other functionalities. For example, trying to access user data before the listener has had a chance to update may result in null values or undefined errors.  The delay is subtle and might not manifest on all platforms, so debugging can be tricky.
